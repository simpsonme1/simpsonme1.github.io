        <h1>HW0: Introduction</h1>

        <p> I was born in Charleston, South Carolina. However, I have also lived in Alabama and Virginia before moving back to 
            Charleston when in seventh grade. I remained in Charleston until I graduated high school from Fort Dorchester, 
            after which my parents moved to Georgia. I am now a junior and a computer science major. My faith, family, friends, and my 
            dog are a few things that are important in my life. My current favorite movie is A Star is Born (the new version). I also enjoy going to the beach and going for
            bike rides, and I have recently taken up knitting over the past year. In other words, I have knitted far too many scarves to live in a state with such hot and humid
            weather.
