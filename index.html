        <h1>HW0: Introduction</h1>

        <p> I was born in Charleston, South Carolina. However, I have also lived in Alabama and Virginia before moving back to 
            Charleston when in seventh grade. I remained in Charleston until I graduated high school from Fort Dorchester, 
            after which my parents moved to Georgia. I am now a junior and a computer science major at College of Charleston. My faith, family, friends, and my 
            dog, an eleven year old lab mix, are a few things that are important in my life. My current favorite movie is A Star is Born (the new version). I also enjoy going to the beach and going for
            bike rides, and I have recently taken up knitting over the past year. (In other words, I have knitted far too many scarves to live in a state with such hot and humid
            weather.) I am excited to further my knowledge of computer science in this software engineering course this semester and to see where my acquired
            knowledge will take me in my future CS career.

            Four important attributes that all professional software should possess include acceptability, dependability and security, efficiency, and maintainability. Other
            attributes that may sometimes be significant may include: 1. creativity in order to appeal to a specific client/user base depending on the purpose of the software,
            2. backward compatibility in order for users to be able to continue using the software with older versions of files and data, 3. being innovative in order to keep up and 
            compete with other rapidly advancing and changing technologies (for example, that of other competing companies), and 4. portability in order to provide users with
            increased mobility of software on any device or operating system they may prefer.
