        <h1>HW0: Introduction</h1>

        <p> I was born in Charleston, South Carolina. However, I have also lived in Alabama and Virginia before moving back to 
            Charleston when in seventh grade. I remained in Charleston until I graduated high school from Fort Dorchester, 
            after which my parents moved to Georgia. I am now a junior and a computer science major at College of Charleston. My faith, family, friends, and my 
            dog, an eleven year old lab mix, are a few things that are important in my life. My current favorite movie is A Star is Born (the new version). I also enjoy going to the beach and going for
            bike rides, and I have recently taken up knitting over the past year. (In other words, I have knitted far too many scarves to live in a state with such hot and humid
            weather.) I am excited to further my knowledge of computer science in this software engineering course this semester and to see where my acquired
            knowledge will take me in my future CS career.

            Four important attributes that all professional software should possess include acceptability, dependability and security, efficiency, and maintainability. Other
            attributes that may sometimes be significant may include: 1. creativity in order to appeal to a specific client/user base depending on the purpose of the software,
            2. backward compatibility in order for users to be able to continue using the software with older versions of files and data, 3. being innovative in order to keep up and 
            compete with other rapidly advancing and changing technologies (for example, that of other competing companies), and 4. portability in order to provide users with
            increased mobility of software on any device or operating system they may prefer.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
           In my opinion, professional engineers should be licensed in the same way as doctors or lawyers in terms of ethical practices. Because the vast majority of society depends daily on the work by software
            engineers, their work could have potential detrimental effects. For example, if a software engineer is developing software for a doctor's office, a level of respect
            and confidentiality should be given to the patients when the developer has access to personal information that may be used maliciously if placed into the wrong hands.
            Software developers have a great knowledge base that allows them to work in a wide variety of fields, which most other professions do not possess. Therefore, the 
            dependability and trustworthiness of software developers is vital to the workings of an ethical society.

            <strong>1.9</strong>        
        </p>
        <p>
            PUBLIC: When developing a website for a large company, a software engineer should not implement a virus into the site that would infect users' computers for the purpose of stealing
            personal information, such as passwords, bank account information, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            CLIENT AND EMPLOYER: If a bug is discovered in an online shopping website by the software engineer, it is expected that the bug will be fixed out of interest for both
            the client and employer. For example, if the website calculates an incorrect amount of state tax owed by the user at checkout, this could negatively effect both the
            client and employer.
        </p>
        <p>
            PRODUCT: If the developer realizes he/she does not have the proper skill set to perform a certain task, he/she should admit this fact and allow a developer with the proper
            expertise to handle the task.
        </p>
        <p>
            JUDGMENT: When a software engineer recognizes a potential overlooked problem in a team's code/work, he/she should know when to speak up about the problem rather than
            knowingly allowing the problematic work to be implemented into practice.
        </p>
        <p>
            MANAGEMENT: A software engineer should give credit where credit is due for work that is not theirs. It is common for developers to use previously written code, but credit
            should be given to the original developer of that code when needed.
        </p>
        <p>
            PROFESSION: Software engineers should do their best to meet proposed deadlines to clients and should not knowingly withhold critical information needed by the client.
        </p>
        <p>
            COLLEAGUES: When a colleage asks for aid on a task they are struggling with, a supportive software engineer will be willing to give advice in a non-condescending manner.
        </p>
        <p>
            SELF: With an ever growing amount of technology, a software engineer should continue to take courses and study new technological advances and innovations in their field.
