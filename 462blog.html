        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>Hello! My name is Megan Simpson and I am a third year computer science student at College of Charleston. I am originally from Charleston but have moved around a few times and now reside in Gumbranch, Georgia when not in Charleston for school. Hot chocolate, bike riding, knitting, and spending time with my friends, family, and dog are just a few of my favorite things. My dog, Cuddy, is a lab-mix and loves to go for rides in the car to Dunkin and Starbucks as much as I do (he has a deep love for puppuccinos). I am also in the process of creating my own website to sell my knitted creations, including warm, soft scarves and hats galore, which allows me to combine my passions for both creativity and computer science. I hope to further my passion for computer science throughout this software engineering practicum course by expanding my knowledge base and gaining valuable experience in preparation for my future occupation.</p>
