        <h1><center>Welcome to my CSCI 462 Software Engineering Practicum Blog!</center></h1>

        <br>

        <h2><center>Introduction</center></h2>

        <p><center>Hello! My name is Megan Simpson and I am a third year computer science student at College of Charleston. I am originally from Charleston but have moved around a few times and now reside in Gumbranch, Georgia when not in Charleston for school. Hot chocolate, bike riding, knitting, and spending time with my friends, family, and dog are just a few of my favorite things. My dog, Cuddy, is a lab-mix and loves to go for rides in the car to Dunkin and Starbucks as much as I do (he has a deep love for puppuccinos). I am also in the process of creating my own website to sell my knitted creations, including warm, soft scarves and hats galore, which allows me to combine my passions for both creativity and computer science. I hope to further my passion for computer science throughout this software engineering practicum course by expanding my knowledge base and gaining valuable experience in preparation for my future occupation.</center></p>

        <h2><center>Reflections on FOSS</center></h2>

        <p><center>So far throughout my experience in CSCI 462 Software Engineering Practicum, I have been grouped with four other students to form team 404-Name-Not-Found. We have scoured several websites in search of a free and open-source software project (FOSS) awaiting our team’s future contributions. Our team was able to find several FOSS projects meeting the requirements of being mature projects with online communities that are welcoming of newcomers. Although we had to sift through many projects that did not seem to meet these basic requirements, it was not a difficult task, nonetheless. What proved more difficult, however, was the actual building of the projects after downloading the project code. There were definitely projects with more detailed and helpful instructions for building the project compared to others. In the end, our team chose Zulip to add our contributions to, as it met all requirements but also had easy-to-follow instructions for building the code, which each member of our team was able to do in a timely manner. Additionally, Zulip appears to be an extremely practical tool that each of our group members can use in our everyday lives – how cool it would be to contribute to something that we would actually use.</center></p>
        <p><center>After reading the assigned article, “The Cathedral and the Bazaar” by Eric Steven Raymond, it was easy to see the benefits of open-source projects like the one my team will be contributing to throughout the semester. One thing that stood out to me in the article was that one reason the open-source Bazaar development model works so well is simply because of the interest in the work from those who are working on the projects. Usually, people are contributing to these open-source projects because they are invested in the work in some way – usually because they are users of the project or simply because they enjoy the types of problems that they are helping to solve. This makes a lot of sense when applied to our CSCI 462 Software Engineering Practicum course; we were able to find a project that our group actually <em>wanted</em> to work on. Another point that stood out to me while reading this article is the idea that “more heads are better than one”. This is something that most people have probably heard since grade school when being forced by teachers to work in pairs or groups with classmates, but I never actually took this saying seriously. I always thought that working in groups simply gave some people a free pass to contribute nothing to the team while a select few put in all the work. However, the people contributing to these open-source projects are generally all motivated to do so because of one reason or another, so I think that the “more heads are better than one” point is actually very reasonable and efficient in the Bazaar model development style. Additionally, there were a few points that Raymond made throughout the article that I had never thought of before, such as the fact that the Cathedral model often offers a limited pool of resources, leading to “resource marshalling”, and the absurd amount of overhead that accompanies this software development style. I think that it will be interesting to see how these points ring true after college graduation if I end up in a job that implements this Cathedral model. </center></p>




        <h2><center>Stupid or Solid?</center></h2>

        <p><center>One theme that I noticed among several of the points made by the articles is to not include more than you have to. For example, the Interface Segregation Principle states that programmers should not implement methods that are not used. If a programmer only wants to implement part of an interface, the programmer should create a new interface that includes only the functionality that the client code requires. Thus, the interface is instead fully implemented. Abiding by this principle allows for low coupling and high cohesion, desirable characteristics for code. Another example is that classes should stick to their purpose and should not have multiple responsibilities, according to the Single Responsibility Principle. Thus, the programmer should not give a class more responsibility than it actually needs. If necessary, a new class should be created instead to give the extra responsibility to. Additionally, the article states that getter and setter methods should only be implemented in the code when they are absolutely necessary, and variables should be set to private by default. Thus, the code does not have more functionality than it needs. This theme of not including more than is necessary seems to be prevalent within the field of computer science as a whole, not merely in programming. For example, one best practice for computer security is to provide only the minimum level of permissions to users and files. Otherwise, more permissions than necessary are likely to cause security breaches with possibly severe consequences. </center></p>
        <p><center>While reading these articles, I was shocked at the fact that students in beginning programming courses were not taught about several of the points that were made. In fact, I had never heard of many of the terms used before, such as the Singleton pattern, despite the fact that it is “probably the most well-known design pattern” as according to William Durand. Because Durand suggests that the Singleton pattern be avoided at all times, despite its popularity, this could be a contributing reason for my previous ignorance to the term. In other words, the fact that the Singleton pattern often leads to tight coupling may have been the reason that our beginning computer programming course professors did not mention the term. Thinking back on my computer programming courses in Python and Java, I remember my professors focusing more on what we should do, rather than what not to do. For example, the Single Responsibility Principle was heavily emphasized, while other parts of SOLID were touched on in varying degrees as well. One big thing, however, that I feel should have been emphasized more in my programming classes is testability of code. While it was mentioned that students should test their code, testing was done on a superficial level and never was the term “tight coupling” mentioned in relation to testing practices. Overall, it seemed strange while reading these articles that, being a third year computer science student, I did not have previous knowledge of several of the points made. Thus, the articles were an enlightening read, helping to build on what I already knew but also offering new knowledge and things to remember for my future programming endeavors. In general, I think that many of the readings we have had so far in CSCI 362/462 have been beneficial in allowing students to see other perspectives and real-life implementation of both S.T.U.P.I.D. and S.O.L.I.D. code.</center></p>
